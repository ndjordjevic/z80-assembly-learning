    ; Example from documentation:
    ; "Register C contains 07h, Register B contains 03h, the HL register pair contains 1000h,
    ; and memory locations contain the following data.
    ; 0FFEh contains 51h
    ; 0FFFh contains A9h
    ; 1000h contains 03h
    ; Upon the execution of an OTDR instruction, the HL register pair contains 0FFDh, Register
    ; B contains a 0, and a group of bytes is written to the peripheral device mapped to I/O port
    ; address 07h in the following sequence: 03h, A9h, 51h"
    
    ; Setup for our example
    ld c, 07h                ; Port number in C
    ld b, 03h                ; Counter in B (and upper byte of port address)
    ld hl, otdr_buffer+2     ; Source memory address (pointing to the end of our buffer)
    
    ; Initialize memory with test data
    ld (hl), 03h             ; Third byte (at highest address)
    dec hl
    ld (hl), 0A9h            ; Second byte (at middle address)
    dec hl
    ld (hl), 51h             ; First byte (at lowest address)
    ld hl, otdr_buffer+2     ; Reset HL to end of buffer
    
    ; In real hardware, this would read repeatedly from memory and output to port (C)
    ; until B becomes zero. Here we'll just simulate the register changes.
    ;otdr                     ; Output from (HL) to port (C), decrement B, decrement HL, repeat until B=0
    
    ; Simulate: decrement HL three times and set B to 0
    dec hl
    dec hl
    dec hl
    ld b, 0
    
    ; Expected final state:
    ; HL = otdr_buffer - 1 - decremented 3 times
    ; B = 0 - decremented to zero
    ; Condition bits:
    ; - S is unknown
    ; - Z is set (because B=0)
    ; - H is unknown
    ; - P/V is unknown
    ; - N is set
    ; - C is not affected
